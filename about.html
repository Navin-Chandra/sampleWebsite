        <h3>A BRIEF SAGA OF B. M. INSTITUTION</h3>
        <p>Bhanderhati B. M. Institution is going to celebrate the quasquicentenary of the institution in January 2018. Established
          in 1894, the supreme task of this historic institution is to impart the students knowledge that culminates wisdom
          – the absolute foundation both of well -being and well –doing. Mrs. Bidhumoni Auddya, the founder, perceived that
          the children of the area should be motivated to serve humanity with dedication and to do so, they should be educated.
          Her dream came true when the school started functioning. Later, Mr. Atul Chowdhury and his kins and Mr. Kanailal
          Mukherjee came forward and took the school to the acme of success.</p>
